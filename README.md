# IND320 - Streamlit App

This repository contains a Streamlit dashboard for the IND320 assignment. The app reads a local CSV file and provides pages for exploring the data (table view with sparklines, a plot explorer, and an extra page).

This README shows how to set up the environment and run the app locally on Windows (PowerShell). It also includes tips for common problems.
